#What is a variable : Variables are lables which act as containers to hold values. In python ,a variable is always associated with some values.
# We use the assignment operator (=) to assign values to a variable.
message = "Hello there! Hope everything if fine"
print(message)

message2 ="Goodbye"
print(message2)

#concatinating variable(Joining two or more outputs together)
message3 = message + message2
print(message3)

# Variables can be named using a letter , number and an underscore . They can start with a letter and underscore but not a number.

name1 = "precious"
print(name1)
# variable names cannot contain spaces we can use underscore to seperate the space.
total_marks = 85
print(total_marks)

#Variable names are not supposed to be key words / reserver characters in python
