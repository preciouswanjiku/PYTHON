# Write a python that is able to culculate the BMI of a person whose weight is 78kgs and height is 1.75 meters. BMI = (Weight)/ (Height Squared)

number1 = 78
number2 = 1.75
BMI = number1 / number2 * number2
print("The BMI is:", BMI)

# Find the area and perimeter of a rectangle whose length is 48cm and width is 25cm
number3 = 48
number4 = 25
perimeter = 4 * number3 + number4
print("The perimeter is:", perimeter)

Area = number3 * number4
print("The area is:", Area)
